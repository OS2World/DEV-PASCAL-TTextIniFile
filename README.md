DEV-PASCAL-TTextIniFile
=======================

 The TTextIniFile class implements textual initialization files. The files are fully interface compatible with the ones in the (Delphi) IniFiles unit, but provide some additional    * methods for reading and writing data other than String, Integer, and Boolean. The files do not use any operating system stuff, so they works alike in OS/2 and Windows.
